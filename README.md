# Geo Programming Language

Geo is an all purpose, dynamically typed programming language.  It is being worked on alongside the book 'Crafting Interpreters', by Robert Nystrom.
Essentially, it is the 'lox' programming language from that book, but with whatever extra/other features I find interesting. 

## TODO:
### Lexer:
- [x] Add support for single line comments
- [x] Add support for multi-line comments
- [x] Lexer properly creates the 'string' type, "like this"
- [x] Lexer properly creates the 'number' type (everything in Geo is a double)

### Parser:
- [ ] Create a tree_printer class that can print out the AST in a nice, tree based form to the console
